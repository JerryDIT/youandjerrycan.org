            <h2>Sort by Relevance</h2>
            <p>Inky's unique relevance view sorts your mail by how meaningful it is to you. Email messages from close contacts have a vibrant blue drop and flow to the top of your message list. Less important mail and spam appears faded and flows to the bottom.</p>

            <h2>Easy Sorting and Filtering</h2>
            <p>Inky's sorting and filtering is easy, requiring only two controls in comparison to the complex table layouts seen in other email clients.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-secondary"><i class="icon-lock"></i>
            <h2>Your Mail Is Safe</h2>
            <p>
              Your mail provider stores your mail, and your mail never touches Inky's own servers. 
              Inky runs on your computer so your email never goes through our network or computers.

          <div class="feature-secondary"><i class="icon-ok"></i>
            <h2>Inky is Flexible</h2>
            <p>
              You can always "go back" after trying Inky. 
              In fact, you can switch back and forth between your providers' websites and Inky anytime. 
              You can also add new accounts at any time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-secondary"><i class="icon-magic"></i>
            <h2>Simple Setup</h2>
            <p>
              All you need to add an email account to Inky is your email address and password. 
              No need to engage in obscure computer science, like researching your port numbers.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-secondary"><i class="icon-refresh"></i>
            <h2>Email Syncing</h2>
            <p>
              Inky keeps your emails intact and in sync with your email provider. 
              For example, if you read a work email message, and then go to the office, 
              you will see that message is marked as read there as well
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-secondary"><i class="icon-share-alt"></i>
            <h2>Smart Sending </h2>
            <p>
              Inky helps you make sure you send your email from the right accounts to the right person. 
              Inky will suggest people to add to an email if you frequently include them in a group.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-secondary"><i class="icon-envelope"></i>
            <h2>No New Email Address</h2>
            <p>
              Inky lets you keep all your existing email addresses. 
              No need to create a new email address to benefit from the latest email technology!

        <h1 style="margin-bottom:60px;">Email is broken<br>and Inky can fix it.</h1>
        <p><strong>Think about it. Email is a big part of our lives. But it's far from perfect.</strong></p>
        <p>
           
          Email is how you keep in touch with friends and family across the country.
          It's how you communicate at work and at home. 
          Whether it's a message from your boss or your mom, email is the go to way to communicate with those you know. 
          Email is also how you receive your flight confirmations, your bank statements, and your shopping receipts and package tracking links.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:40px;">
          Unfortunately, important messages are often hard to find among everything else that's crowding up your inbox today: daily deals,
          social notifications, special offers from your favorite stores, and the list goes on and on. 
          Most people find themselves spending a lot more time on their email than they should.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Inky can make email better.</strong></p>
        <p>
          Inky saves you time by displaying all your email messages in one place sorted by relevance. As soon as you sign in
          for the first time, Inky goes to work figuring out what mail is important to you and helps you find it by placing it above all the other clutter.
          Inky is customizable and can sort and filter by all the usual criteria as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you have one account or five, Inky provides a new, refreshingly simple interface to check all your mail. 
          From one click unsubscribe to package tracking, Inky's smart tools help you get things done and get on with your life.
        </p>
        <p>
           
          Inky represents a fresh take on email. Enjoy your email again.

      <div id="about-arcode" class="container">
        <h1 style="margin-bottom:60px;">The Arcode Team</h1>
        <p>
          Inky was built with care by Arcode, a privately-held company based in Bethesda, Maryland which was founded in 2010 by 
          Dave Baggett (cofounder of ITA Software and cocreator of the Crash Bandicoot video game franchise).  
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arcode team consists of experts and Ph.D. researchers in many different fields, including artificial intelligence, 
          natural language processing, machine learning, big data, low-level coding, computing infrastructure, computer languages, platforms, 
          and environments, operations management, mobility optimization, and graphics.
        </p>
        <p>Almost everyone on the team is a code jockey, contributing directly to Inky’s creation.</p>

      <div id="faq" class="container">
        <h1 style="margin-bottom:60px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p> <strong>How much does Inky cost?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">It's free!</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need to create a new email address?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">No. Inky works with your current email accounts. You can also add new accounts at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>Can your employees read my mail?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">No. Your mail provider stores your mail, and your email never goes through our network or computers.</p>
        <p> <strong>Will using Inky mess up my mail?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">No. Inky keeps your emails intact and in sync with your email provider. For example, If you read a work email message, and then go to the office, you will see that the message is marked as read there as well. You can always “go back” after trying Inky. In fact, you can switch back and forth between your providers' web sites and Inky any time you want.</p>
        <p><strong>If I send mail using Inky, will it still look like it's coming from me?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">Yes. When you compose a message, you can send it from any of your accounts. Messages sent using Inky look exactly the same as if you had sent them using your provider's web site.</p>
        <p><strong>Are my email passwords stored on Inky's servers?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">Inky connects to your email providers and processes your mail on your machine. Your email data never passes through our servers. Inky stores your email passwords encrypted on our servers, but the decryption key is your Inky password. This means that no one -- not even Inky employees -- can access your data without knowing your password. This also means that you can have one Inky account for multiple computers because your information is transfered encrypted through the cloud.</p>
